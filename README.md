I have completed my first 8 projects in the C# training camp that we started under the guidance of Murat Yücedağ. You can view it in detail below.

✅Project 1: Print Commands
I learned Console.Read() and Console.WriteLine() commands to write to the console.
✅Project 2: Variables
I learned to define and use different data types (double, int, float, bool..)
✅Project 3: Decision Structures 
I learned to condition the if else-if else structure
✅Project 4: Loops
I learned repetitive operations with for while loops
✅Project 5: Loops(star)
I printed out how to make a star on the console in different ways with loops.
✅Project 6:Arrays
I learned the array structure, applied the storage logic and learned how to process it.
✅Project 7: Foreach Cycle and Exam System 
I learned the foreach loop structure and created an exam simulation using the structures we have learned so far.
✅Project 6: Methods
I learned methods with and without parameters and created methods that return results in the console.
